# Overview

Cookie Quick Manager: A complete manager for cookies used during browsing.
It allows you to view, edit, create, delete, backup, restore cookies and search them by domain names;
private browsing is also supported.

Cookie Quick Manager is designed for developers, testers or people
concerned about their privacy on the Internet.

This WebExtension is compatible with Firefox 57 and is inspired by addons like
[Cookies Manager+](https://addons.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/addon/cookies-manager-plus/) and
[Advanced Cookie Manager](https://addons.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/addon/cookie-manager/)
whose development has been discontinued due to the withdrawal of the support for "Legacy" extensions.

# Features

A user can search for cookies of a domain and subdomains which depend on it.

All the attributes of a cookie can be modified: domain, path, name, value,
expiration date, as well as secure and httponly flags.

The export and import of a cookie or cookies from a domain in JSON format is just as easy.

Each parameter and functionality is briefly described when the mouse is over the element.

# Privacy

This addon does not store any personal information.

It requires the following permissions to operate:

* Host permission for all urls: This allows you to edit the cookies of any visited site,
* Cookies: Allows access to the browser's cookie manager,
* ActiveTab: Allows access to the consulted url, and favicon if it exists.

# Support & source code

The extension is in full development with the launch of Firefox Quantum;
questions, bug reports and feature requests are open on the
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/ysard/cookie-quick-manager/issues).
